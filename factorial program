# Create Factorial of a number using function:
def factorial(n):
    x = 1
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        x = x * i
        print(f"{x}")
a = int(input("Enter a number:"))
factorial(a)

#OUTPUT OF ABOVE PROGRAM IS AS FOLLOWS:
Enter a number:5
5
20
60
120



#CREATE A FACTORIAL PROGRAM USING FUNCTION:

    x = 1
    b = x
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        x = x * i
    b = print("The factorial of ", a, "is", x)
a = int(input("Enter a number:"))
factorial(a)

#OUTPUT OF ABOVE PROGRAM IS AS FOLLOWS:
Enter a number:5
The factorial of 5 is 120
